Inspired by http://codespatter.com/2009/07/01/django-model-manager-soft-delete-how-to-customize-admin/

This project mostly exists to be able to provide undelete of soft-deleted objects, along with proper
undeletion of related objects.

Requirements:

There are simple templates files in templates/.  You will need to add Django's
egg loader to use the templates as is:

TEMPLATE_LOADERS = (
...
    'django.template.loaders.eggs.Loader',
)

Add the project 'softdelete' to your INSTALLED_APPS for 
through-the-web undelete support.

INSTALLED_APPS = (
...
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'softdelete',
)
